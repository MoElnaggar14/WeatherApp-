# WeatherApp-
Simple Weather IOS App using Swift 4 that a good practice in working with API and Core Location 

this simple app is a good practice to working with API 
i use api from two sites : http://openweathermap.org/api that really aswome and clear and free api but unfortunately the API doc for 16 days turned to Pricing package so
i use API For 16 Days from anthor site called https://api.weatherbit.io but i don't recommened it for use in Real Apps 
good practice to work with Core Location library , working with constrains , UIStackView that Really importance.
a simple example to implement tableview and tableview cell
